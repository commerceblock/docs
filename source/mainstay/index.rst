Introduction
============

Mainstay is a protocol that enables sidechains - employing federated
consensus algorithms - to cryptographically bind to an immutable proof-of-work mainchain
in a way that it is impossible for the sidechain to fork without simultaneously forking the
mainchain. The underlying construction of this method requires no changes to the existing
proof-of-work system (e.g. Bitcoin) and is space-efficient and censorship resistant due to
the use of homomorphic commitments based on the pay-to-contract protocol. In addition,
the method is implemented using a multisignature scheme to maintain consistency with the
security guarantees and Byzantine fault tolerance of federated consensus. These protocols
enable the realisation of highly efficient, scalable and interoperable sidechain systems that can
incorporate advanced smart-contracting and privacy features while simultaneously exploiting
the full security and immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain secured via proof-of-work.
