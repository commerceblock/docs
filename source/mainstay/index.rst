Introduction
============

**Mainstay** is a protocol that enables the creation of a cryptographic *proof* that a given system with changing state is *unique* and that the full *history* of that state is unique. This proof is generated from a series of cryptographic commitments made to a public blockchain which in turn derives its immutability and global state from a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. In this way, any independent system with history of state (for example a federated blockchain/sidechain of a Git repository) can be proven to be as immutable as the Proof-of-Work blockchain it is secured by. The *proof of immutability* (PoI) generated by the Mainstay protocol is *trustless* and independently verifiable. 

The underlying construction of the Mainstay protocol requires no changes to the existing
proof-of-work system (e.g. Bitcoin) and requires no cooperation of miners (unlike merge mining protocols). It is specifically designed to be space-efficient and censorship resistant due tothe use of homomorphic commitments based on the *pay-to-contract* method (**BIP175**). The Mainstay *Connector* protocol enables many separate systems to obtain independent proofs of immutability via a single sequence of commtiments, by compressing sequences of commitments in a Merkel tree of *slots*. This enables the minimisation of burden on to the Bitcoin blockchain, and thousands of sidechains can be secured with just a single Bitcoin transaction per block. This enables the realisation of highly efficient, scalable and interoperable sidechain systems that can
incorporate permissioned transacting and regulatory compliance while simultaneously exploiting
the full security and immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain secured via proof-of-work.

This documentation describes the theory and implementaion of the Mainstay protocol, as well as an explanation of the background, motivation and how the protocol differs from trustless timestamping (Proof of Existence - PoE). This documentaion also includes detailed instructions on using CommerceBlock's Mainstay implimentaion and tooling, CommerceBlock's Mainstay service and API as well as stop-by-step guides for sidechain integration.
