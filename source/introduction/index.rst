Enabling the next evolution in financial infrastructure

CommerceBlockâ€˜s public blockchain based infrastructure enables the distribution, exchange and storage of tokenized assets and securities. We have created an open-source ecosystem utilizing sidechains together with an attestation service (MainStay) to combine the immutability and security of public blockchains with the flexibility of permissioned blockchains.

To facilitate seamless transactions and comply with regulatory requirements, we developed the Ocean sidechain codebase, which is built from the Bitcoin protocol, with easy-to-use KYC, whitelist/blacklist and other regulatory functions.
