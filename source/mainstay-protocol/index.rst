Protocol
============

The MainStay protocol employs the underlying concept of a *staychain* of linked transactions within the Bitcoin mainchain, 
where all transactions in the staychain conform to having only a a single output, 
preventing branching and any possibility of alternate staychain
histories. By anchoring the staychain *base* transaction ID into the genesis block of the sidechain,
and then committing the state of the sidechain at regular intervals into the staychain, it
becomes impossible to roll back or re-write the state of the sidechain without also rolling
back the staychain, which is effectively impossible due to the might of Bitcoin’s global proof-
of-work. Sidechain nodes can validate these commitments and the resulting immutability of
the staychain via a connection to a Bitcoin full node. When a sidechain
block has been committed to a Bitcoin staychain, this block has been *reinforced* and is as
immutable as a Bitcoin block of the same depth. 

To minimise the encumbrance of the mainstay on the Bitcoin blockchain, and to prevent any
potential miner censorship of transactions containing ``OP_RETURN`` outputs, a
homomorphic commitment scheme based on the ‘pay-to-contract’ (`BIP175 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0175.mediawiki>`_) protocol is employed. In this approach, commitments from the sidechain are embedded in a single transaction output
address, and the staychain is indistinguishable from normal Bitcoin payment transactions.
The scheme has been designed so that it is compatible with both multisig (P2SH) and single 
public key (P2PKH) addresses via `BIP32 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki>`_ derivation paths. 

The aim of the MainStay protocol is to restrict a sequence of periodic commitments from an external system (referred to here as 
the *sidechain* without loss of generality) to 
an un-forkable staychain of transactions in Bitcoin, and to uniquely
bind this staychain to the sidechain by commiting the transaction identifier directly the sidechain genesis block. We define a staychain
as a sequence of linked transactions where each one has only a single output - transactions
can have more than one input (*fan-in*), but maintaining single outputs means only one
sequence of commitments is possible from a given initial transaction. Each unique
transaction output then represents a *single use seal*.

If the security proposition of a sidechain depends on the Mainstay proof-of-immutability then
the mechanism of propagating the staychain must be robust and reliable: if the
staychain fails to propagate or is corrupted (e.g. having multiple outputs) then new sidechain state changes (i.e. blocks)
will lose the guarantee of immutability - howver it will remain *fail secure* (i.e. previously reinforced transactions are provably unique). 

Single-key protocol
--------------------------

In the following general description of the protocol, we assume a single Mainstay key and signing entity. The
protocol is also presented in relation to Bitcoin as the proof-of-work mainchain, but it is in
principle compatible with any PoW blockchain.

outputs only one possible sequence of transactions is possible.

Initialisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial step in the protocol is the creation of the base transaction ``TxID_0``, which is
performed before the initialisation of the sidechain. 

1. The signing entity generates a ``BIP32`` extended master private key ``xpriv`` , and corresponding extended master public key ``xpub``. The extended public key is then used to create the base address: ``Addr[0]`` with a derivation path of ``m/0``. 
2. The signing entity then creates a transaction (the *base transaction* ``BaseTx``) paying an amount of BTC (to cover at least initial transaction fees) to the base address ``Addr[0]`` as a single P2PKH output.
3. This transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network: once it is confirmed in the Bitcoin blockchain it acquires a globally unique transaction ID that is a pointer to the start of the staychain: ``TxID[0]``. 
4. The sidechain is then configured and linked to the Bitcoin staychain. The pointer ``TxID[0]`` is embedded directly in the genesis block of the sidechain as metadata in a defined location, along with the ``xpub``. 

Commitments
^^^^^^^^^^^

The frequency of state commitments is determined by the signing entity : the sidechain may
generate blocks more frequently but can only attest once per Bitcoin block (average every
10 minutes). The process of attestation will occur as follows:

1. At each interval ``j``, the signing entity will retrieve the sidechain best block hash ``blockhash[j]``
2. The 32 byte ``blockhash[j]`` is then split into 16 2-byte parts, which are then converted into an array of 16 integers ``bhint[16]``. 
3. A BIP32 derivation path (the commitment path ``path[j]``) is formed from this integer array sequence, and prepended with ``m/0``. 
4. The commitment address ``Addr[j]`` is then derived from the ``xpub`` with ``path[j]``. 

For example: 

::
	blockhash_j = 310057788c6073640dc222466d003411cd5c1cc0bf2803fc6ebbfae03ceb4451

	path_j = m/0/12544/22392/35936/29540/3522/8774/27904/13329/52572/7360/48936/1020/28347/64224/15595/17489

5. The signing entity then creates a Bitcoin transaction with one input spending the single output of transaction ``TxID[j-1]``
(initially the base transaction when ``j = 1``) and paying to a single
P2PKH output with address ``Addr[j]``
6. The transaction is then signed using the private key derived from ``xpriv`` with ``path[j-1]``
7. The valid transaction is then broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Once it is confirmed
in a block, it is referenced by transaction ID: ``TxID[j]``

Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A block generated on a sidechain that has a mainstay commitment is known as *reinforced*
and has the same immutability guarantees as a confirmed Bitcoin block. For any client or
user to confirm the status of a sidechain block only requires connections to both Bitcoin and sidechain full nodes. 
No additional information, beyond what is included
in the sidechain and Bitcoin blockchains, is required to validate direct mainstay reinforcements. 

This confirmation functions as follows:

1. The base transaction ID ``TxID[0]`` is retrieved from the sidechain genesis block along with the master ``xpub``
2. ``TxID[0]`` is retrieved from the Bitcoin blockchain. 
3. The staychain is tracked until the unspent tip ``TxID[t]``, confirming each
component transaction consists of only a single output:

::
	TxID[0] → TxID[1] → TxID[2] → TxID[3] → ... → TxID[t]

4. The single output P2PKH address of ``TxID[t]`` is retrieved: ``Addr[t]``
5. Starting at the tip (most recent confirmed block) of the sidechain (block ``w``)
with block hash ``blockhash[w]``, the corresponding BIP32 path is determined: ``path[w]``. 
6. ``Addr[w]`` is derived from ``path[w]`` and the master ``xpub``
7. If ``Addr[w]`` equals ``Addr[t]`` block ``w`` on the sidechain (and all below it) are confirmed as
reinforced. 
8. If not true, the sidechain block height is decremented: ``w ← w − 1`` and the check
repeated.

The above protocol would only need to be followed for the initial sync of a mainstay connected
node: once the staychain tip transaction ``TxID[t]`` has been identified, additional attestations
can be confirmed by monitoring when ``TxID[t]``
is removed from the Bitcoin UTXO set. The
new staychain tip ``TxID[t+1]`` will then be included in the most recent Bitcoin block.

Staychain feed in
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To maintain the persistent operation of a staychain, it must be continually funded to pay
for mainchain (Bitcoin) mining fees. The staychain can always be funded with a substantial 
amount of Bitcoin at the beginning (i.e. at the base transaction stage) however it may
be required to ‘top-up’ the funding at a later stage. This is possible without breaking
the immutability of the staychain: the only required condition for immutability is that
there is always only one output of any transaction in the chain - and that the staychain
cannot bifurcate. Inputs however can be added by anyone: additional funding can be added
with ``SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`` inputs. The base transaction will always define the
commitment sequence through to the tip. 

Federated protocol
-------------------

An important property of the Mainstay protocol is that it does not require trust in any
party, including the entity holding the staychain base private key (``xpriv``) to confirm that
a given sidechain state is immutable. However trust is required in this entity to ensure
that the mainstay is persistent, and that the system continues to operate (i.e. commitments
continue to be generated). If the key was stolen then an attacker could steal the Bitcoin in
the staychain tip output and prevent further confirmations. To remedy this, the sidechain
would need to be hard-forked to reset the mainstay (i.e. to commit a new base transaction into
the sidechain). 

Sidechains can be operated using a federated consensus protocol, where a fixed federation of
separate entities are required to cooperate to generate a new block to add to the blockchain. 
This is typically implemented with ``m`` distinct entities, where a threshold of ``n`` are required
to add their signature to generate a new valid block. This has the advantage of being very
scalable and efficient, and also retains some level of decentralisation, not requiring trust in
any single entity. In the case of a federated sidechain employing Mainstay to Bitcoin, the
operation of Mainstay can achieve the same security properties and guarantees as the
federated block signing protocol. In this case, the staychain would be controlled with an n of
m multisignature script: ``n`` signers are required to cooperate to operate the Mainstay. ``m − n``
keys can be lost or compromised and the Mainstay will still function.
This requires some modifications to the protocol described above, as follows.


Initialisation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Each signing node ``i`` where ``i = 1, ..., m`` generates a master extended private key ``xpriv[i]`` 
and corresponding extened public ``xpub[i]``
2. The signing nodes then cooperate to create an ``n`` of ``m`` multisig redeem script (where
``m`` is the total number of signing nodes and ``n`` is the number of signatures required)
containing ``m`` base public keys derived from each ``xpub[i]``  via a path ``m/0``. 
The redeem script is then hashed to create a P2SH address ``Addr[0]``. 
3. A transaction is then created with ``Addr[0]`` as a single P2SH
output and funded with with sufficient BTC for initial fees and then broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
4. Once confirmed, it is now publicly verifiable that the redeem
script hash corresponds to the published ``n`` , ``m`` and all the ``xpub[i]``.
6) The TxID of the transaction ``TxID[0]`` is retrieved and committed into the genesis
block of the sidechain along with each ``xpub[i]``. 


Commitments
^^^^^^^^^^^

1. At each attestation interval ``j``, each of the mainstay signing nodes ``i`` will independently
retrieve the sidechain tip block hash ``blockhash[j][i]``
2. Each node splits the 32 byte ``blockhash[j][i]`` is then split into 16 2-byte parts, which are then converted into an array of 16 integers ``bhint[16]``. 
3. A BIP32 derivation path (the commitment path ``path[j][i]``) is formed from this integer array sequence, and prepended with ``m/0``. 
4. For each node ``i``, The commitment public key ``pubkey[j][i]`` is then derived from the ``xpub[i]`` with ``path[j][i]``. 
5. ``n`` of ``m`` signing nodes then combine ``pubkey[j][i]`` to derive a redeem script and corresponding P2SH address ``Addr[j]``. 
6. A transaction spending the single output of ``TxID[j−1]`` and paying to ``Addr[j]`` is created. 
7. ``n`` of ``m`` signing nodes then verify that ``Addr[0]`` corresponds to the correctly dervied base keys. 
8. The transaction is then signed by each of ``n`` (any subset of ``m``) signing nodes in turn
using the derived private key ``xpriv[i]`` with ``path[j-1][i]``. 
9. The transaction is then broadcast to the Bitcoin network, validated and then mined
into a block, generating ``TxID[j]``

.. note::
 	Bitcoin multisig redeem scripts are structured as follows: ``OP_n pubkey[1] pubkey[2] ... pubkey[m] OP_m OP_CHECKMULTISIG``


Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The base transaction ID ``TxID[0]`` is retrieved from the sidechain genesis block along with the ``n`` master ``xpub[i]``
2. ``TxID[0]`` is retrieved from the Bitcoin blockchain. 
3. The staychain is tracked until the unspent tip ``TxID[t]``, confirming each
component transaction consists of only a single output:

::
	TxID[0] → TxID[1] → TxID[2] → TxID[3] → ... → TxID[t]

4. The single output P2SH address of ``TxID[t]`` is retrieved: ``Addr[t]``
5. Starting at the tip (most recent confirmed block) of the sidechain (block ``w``)
with block hash ``blockhash[w]``, the corresponding BIP32 path is determined: ``path[w]``. 
6. ``Addr[w]`` is derived from ``path[w]`` and ``m`` of the master ``xpub[i]``
7. If ``Addr[w]`` equals ``Addr[t]`` block ``w`` on the sidechain (and all below it) are confirmed as
reinforced. 
8. If not true, the sidechain block height is decremented: ``w ← w − 1`` and the check
repeated.
