ERC20-Sidechain bridge
=======================

A short guide on how to peg-in CBT tokens from the Ethereum network to Ocean and peg-out back to Ethereum.

The following steps assume that the user is running a full Ocean node connected to the CommerceBlock mainnet. The node needs to be synced up and with RPC connectivity enabled. Connectivity to a geth node is optional but it would allow doing the same validation checks that a signing node does for the peg-in transaction.

**Step 1**

Export the private key of the ethereum address that owns the CBT tokens. This should be in hex format, e.g.
::

    "0xcb850d9db23b54ebbeae09995f7192af83646f9ea232645bb5a71699e5c15a6e"

**Step 2**

Run the ``getethpeginaddress`` RPC using this private key (with the "0x" prefix removed):

.. code-block:: bash

    ocean-cli getethpeginaddress cb850d9db23b54ebbeae09995f7192af83646f9ea232645bb5a71699e5c15a6e
    {
      "eth_mainchain_address": "b6872561de5ba19d38071a7616d9d434b9e37860",
      "eth_claim_pubkey": "03664b8a3e065329c6bb3b8f9f0bb382179775f609ffa9ff564ea6f20e913ec04b"
    }


**Step 3**

Pay the CBT tokens to the ``eth_mainchain_address`` returned from the ``getethpeginaddress`` RPC and save the transaction id. The transaction will require a minimum amount of 10 confirmations before being allowed to peg-in.


**Step 4**

Run the ``claimethpegin`` RPC using the ``eth_claim_pubkey`` returned above, the transaction id and the CBT amount as:

.. code-block:: bash

    ocean-cli claimethpegin $txid $amount 03664b8a3e065329c6bb3b8f9f0bb382179775f609ffa9ff564ea6f20e913ec04b

**Step 5**

Run the ``getbalance`` RPC and verify that the CBT has been pegged in to the Ocean network.

**Step 6**

To peg-out this CBT will require running the ``sendtoethmainchain`` RPC specifying an address to send the CBT to as well as the amount to peg-out:

.. code-block:: bash

    ocean-cli sendtoethmainchain 8e8a0ec05cc3c2b8511aabadeeb821df19ea7564 0.1


Issues with unconfirmed peg-ins
-------------------------------

Failing to follow the above steps correctly or attempting to claim the peg-in before the minimum number of confirmations has been reached will cause the transaction getting stuck in the user's mempool. The node will periodically relay the transaction and that will work for transactions missing confirmations but not on any other case.

To resolve issues with stuck transactions follow the instructions below:

* Stop the CB node
* Delete the mempool.dat file
* Add -zapwallettxes=1 to the node configuration
* Restart the CB node
* Re-submit claimethpegin with the correct information

An alternative option is to backup the wallet.dat file and create a new node, importing the previous wallet.

To display network rejection messages for transactions the config option `-debug=net` can be added to the CB node. That should give some hints on why the claim peg-in transaction is rejected.
