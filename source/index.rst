Welcome to CommerceBlock Network's documentation!
=================================================

CommerceBlockâ€˜s public blockchain based infrastructure enables the distribution, exchange and storage of tokenized assets and securities.
We have created an open-source ecosystem utilizing sidechains together with an attestation service (MainStay) to combine the immutability and security of public blockchains with the flexibility of permissioned blockchains.
