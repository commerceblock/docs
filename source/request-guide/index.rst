Request guide
===============

A guide for creating service requests in the CommerceBlock chain.

1. Running the service chain full node

Download the docker-compose file from `ocean github <https://github.com/commerceblock/ocean/tree/master/contrib/docker>`_ and follow the `docs <https://commerceblock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running-node/index.html>`_ instructions on how to run the node using data persistence.

The full node wallet will need to be funded with PERMISSION assets in order to create requests. This can be done by paying to an address generated by the node or import a private key from another wallet.

2. Create a request

The following script can be used to create a request. The following parameters need to be filled:
- Client chain genesis hash
- Number of tickets
- Fee percentage paid
- Start block height
- End block height
- Starting auction price
- Auction decay constant

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    shopt -s expand_aliases

    alias ocl="ocean-cli -rpcport=7043 -rpcuser=ocean -rpcpassword=oceanpass"

    echo "Creating request in service chain"

    # Address permission tokens will be locked in
    pub=`ocl validateaddress $(ocl getnewaddress) | jq -r ".pubkey"`
    # Get permission asset unspent
    unspent=`ocl listunspent 1 9999999 [] true "PERMISSION" | jq .[0]`
    value=`echo $unspent | jq -r ".amount"`
    txid=`echo $unspent | jq ".txid"`
    vout=`echo $unspent | jq -r ".vout"`

    # TO UNLOCK A PREVIOUS REQUEST
    # Provide the `txid` and `vout` for that transaction
    # The output can be spent after the locktime is expired

    # Client chain genesis block hash
    genesis=""
    # Request start height
    start=
    # Request end height
    end=
    # Number of tickets
    tickets=
    # Starting price
    price=
    # Fee percentage paid
    fee=
    # Decay constant
    decay=1000000

    # Generate and sign request transaction
    inputs="{\"txid\":$txid,\"vout\":$vout}"
    outputs="{\"decayConst\":$decay,\"endBlockHeight\":$end,\"fee\":$fee,\"genesisBlockHash\":\"$genesis\",\
    \"startBlockHeight\":$start,\"tickets\":$tickets,\"startPrice\":$price,\"value\":$value,\"pubkey\":\"$pub\"}"

    signedtx=`ocl signrawtransaction $(ocl createrawrequesttx $inputs $outputs)`
    txid=`ocl sendrawtransaction $(echo $signedtx | jq -r ".hex")`
    echo "txid: $txid"

3. Monitor a request

Check that a request has been included in the chain using:

.. code-block:: bash

    ocean-cli getrequests

Download the `report script <https://github.com/commerceblock/coordinator/blob/develop/scripts/report.py>`_, replace the `txid` parameter with the request id parameter and run this script to monitor the guardnode response performance.

This will only work once the request has become active.
